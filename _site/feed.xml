&lt;p&gt;This summer I had the pleasure of having an internship at &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntoprogram.tv/&quot;&gt;Learn To Program &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to expect coming in to the internship and was a bit scared I would have nothing to offer them. Maybe I didn’t who knows …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first task was to write &lt;a href=&quot;http://learntoprogram.wpengine.com/ruby-language-beginners/&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on an introduction to Ruby, the language which I know strongest. It took a couple of drafts but finally I presented something good enough to post on their blog. A few people have liked it on Facebook so I guess it can’t be too bad. During the process I got to know Ben, a college student working there for the summer. We made a good combo because he could write well and I knew programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next assignment was to write solutions to the labs on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntoprogram.tv/courses/html5-specialist-designation&quot;&gt;HTML5 Course &lt;/a&gt; on their site. This wasn’t too difficult but I had to make sure it was all correct. I would feel pretty bad if my answer was wrong and a student learned the wrong way from my answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After small tasks in between, I was given a large project. I was tasked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drewburns/SummerInternship/tree/master/Learn%20To%20Program%20App&quot;&gt; creating an app that would allow access to one of their courses &lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to create an app that would load an JSON file of a course and fill in the text/videos/images using the same layout for each course. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Phone Gap to make the app. After about three weeks of work, I finished the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I learned valuable lessons and skills of working as a team. It was an absolute pleasure to work for this company.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary>GitHub Repo</summary></entry><entry><title>Bite App</title><link href="http://drewburns.github.io/Bite-App/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bite App" /><published>2016-03-30T18:47:20-04:00</published><updated>2016-03-30T18:47:20-04:00</updated><id>http://drewburns.github.io/Bite-App</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://drewburns.github.io/Bite-App/">&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drewburns/BiteApp&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this app as a joke originally. My precalc teacher is a pretty funny guy and has a lot of catch phrases he often says. I wanted to make an app for him that allowed him to have the phone say the phrases for him. So I made this app that allows the user to record sounds and also have the phone speak text.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I learned:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How to use diction&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How to record sounds&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How to store sounds&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Making custom color scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I want to add:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Play sounds in slo-mo or fast&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Put filters over the voice&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Make it look better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I am taking chemistry this year and after hearing a million and a half chemistry jokes, I decided to make an app. The app sends you a daily chemistry joke. The jokes all come from a simple Rails &lt;a href=&quot;http://chemistryjokeapi.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; I created.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I learned:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Timers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Notifications&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the Stanford lecture about animation, I decided to wait on doing their Breakout Game and instead made this. The idea was to make a cool way to visualize a song using animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now the app only is able to play one song but I hope to come back and change that. The only way I was able to get the song breakdown data was in Javascript(wrote some of the code but used a library). This meant I had to copy the output from the Javascript into the app. The idea was to have all the songs on the phone work, but it was getting to the point where the time it took wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Swift&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing Songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push Animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding subviews with code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Javascript&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decoding Songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading Songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

You wait forever for one, and then two come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Github: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drewburns/RecipeApp&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recipe App I created was in lieu of the Twitter app assignment by the Stanford Course. Some of their files were not compatable with the new Swift version, so I took it upon myself to make a similar project from stratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The App:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app ran on the backend of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://givemerecipes.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;GiveMeRecipes&lt;/a&gt; rails site I made a while back. I had to reconfigure the store of the files of the images for the website using Cloudinary. It took a long time to figure out what I was doing, but after that I was able to upload images from the app and send them to the app through the custom API that needed to be made for the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app allows users to log in and out using their accounts from the site.From there, the user can view all recipes, see specific user’s recipes, or view a single recipe. Creating recipes from the app is also very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Swift&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Scroll Views&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Autolayout&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;HTTP Requests&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Closures/Completion Handlers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Images&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Table Views&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;HTTP Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Rails&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to make API&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Image Storage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;HTTP Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What I could add&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to add a sign up page and a search feature to look for recipes. I attempted to make a search feature in the app but I couldn’t get it to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary>Blog posts are like buses.

&lt;p&gt;This is my first project in Swift, the newest language I am learning.
Swift is a whole new animal but the more I learn, the more it is similar to languages like Ruby and Javascript. This is a homework assignment from the Stanford Swift iTunes U class. Navigating Xcode is a challenge and getting used to the syntax of the code is quite difficult but the more I use it, the more I seem to like it. In this project, I learned all the basics of Swift and Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;XCode:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Navigation Controller&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Split View Controller&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Auto layout&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Closures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Classes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MVC's in Swift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Functions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Casting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recursion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;init&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;UIBeizerPath / Bounds / Gestures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is pretty cool to see the app pop up on your phone and actually work like something you can download on the App Store. The next project will be a recipe app that uses an API I made in Rails.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary>The code : github</summary></entry><entry><title>Avviso News</title><link href="http://drewburns.github.io/Avviso-News/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Avviso News" /><published>2015-10-18T10:25:05-04:00</published><updated>2015-10-18T10:25:05-04:00</updated><id>http://drewburns.github.io/Avviso-News</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://drewburns.github.io/Avviso-News/">&lt;p&gt;The site tutorial : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avviso.news/tutorial&quot;&gt;avviso.news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: The Beginnings &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a project I have been working on for months. It actually started a few years back during the Israel and Gaza conflict. Watching the news, I noticed how the story only mentioned the fact that the Israeli missles killed civilians but did nothing to tell about the weapons harbored in those buildings. It made me think, &lt;b&gt;there should be a news source that is non partisan, where the user not only gets the facts, but can learn different views, therefore being able to choose their own. The site started as a place for all news, but after realizing that approach was too broad, I switched to covering just the 2016 election.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became the message of the site and as the site was being developed, it became a site where users post the news. I summarize this idea with the phrase, &lt;b&gt;“News for the people, by the people”.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 2: The Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site, like every one I have made before used Ruby on Rails. This site tied together skills I have been learning for years and included learning some new ones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Skills I Used Already Known&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Database Relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Web Scraping-(Searches sources posted for the best image possible)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Regular Expressions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Devise and user authentication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ajax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;New Skills Learned&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nested Comments / Ancestery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reputation / Voting System&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log functions to rank items-(time since created versus votes)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DNS Setting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Automatic color contrasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the site took a few months of on and off working, and is still getting better every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 3: The Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already started the twitter account and have 11 followers as of now. This may not seem like a lot, but these are people who are actively engaging with the account and will probably become users. The user count for the website at the moment is 14 with all users being people I know.
The goal for now is to make all the posts and comments myself until people begin doing it. No one wants to go to a blank website. I am going after users who are politically active who will hopefully become active users on the site. The idea is to create a community that will use the site often and then to go after site readers who may occasionally post something. It will take time for the site to grow, but I am ready for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary>The site tutorial : avviso.news

I decided to take a break from Rails over the past week and learn about CSS animations.
I have used the library called Animate.css for some of my projects, but I wanted to learn how to make my own animations.
I learned there are a few components to make an item come to life. First you need the object that the animation will be used on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sun&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to make the animation that will be used. This is done by making a keyframes sequence and applying it to that item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sun-pattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;gold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#FE5B35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#FEFCD7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.sun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sun-pattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alternate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this animation will continue forever, taking 20 seconds to complete. It will also have a 3 second buffer time and when the animation finishes, it will go again except backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also experimented a little bit with svg, or scalable vector graphics. I wanted a cloud shape for my animation but didn’t want to go looking for images to use. I ended up using a code snippet I found online for a cloud shape. After reading more about svg, I learned that it is a way of using a grid system to draw lines and make shapes that can be easily scaled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cloud-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;viewBox=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'0 0 105 105'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I decided to take a break from Rails over the past week and learn about CSS animations.
I have used the library called Animate.css for some of my projects, but I wanted to learn how to make my own animations.
I learned there are a few components to make an item come to life. First you need the object that the animation will be used on.

 &amp;lt;div class=&quot;sun&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

Then you need to make the animation that will be used. This is done by making a keyframes sequence and applying it to that item.

 @keyframes sun-pattern {
	0% {
		background-color: gold;
	}
	50% {
		transform: translate(0,600px);
		background-color: #FE5B35;
	}
	100% {
		background-color: #FEFCD7;
	}
}
.sun {
	animation: sun-pattern 20s 3s infinite alternate;
}</summary></entry></feed>
