Here is the <a href="https://github.com/drewburns/BiteApp">GitHub</a> page

I made this app as a joke originally. My precalc teacher is a pretty funny guy and has a lot of catch phrases he often says. I wanted to make an app for him that allowed him to have the phone say the phrases for him. So I made this app that allows the user to record sounds and also have the phone speak text.
<br><br>
<h3>What I learned:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>How to use diction</li>
 	<li>How to record sounds</li>
 	<li>How to store sounds</li>
 	<li>Making custom color scheme</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I want to add:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Play sounds in slo-mo or fast</li>
 	<li>Put filters over the voice</li>
 	<li>Make it look better</li>
</ul>
Instead of me writing about how the app works, here is a video:
