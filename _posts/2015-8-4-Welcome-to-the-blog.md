My name is Andrew Burns I am currently 16 at the time of this post and I'm an aspiring entrepreneur and programmer. I don't want to bore you so I'll try to make things on here short. 

I decided I wanted to become an entrepreneur when I was 11 years old. I would spend all day during school jotting down inventions and ideas. Some of them are silly but some I still think about. I was blessed to meet a woman by the name of Mrs. Reilly. Other than teaching me 8th grade English, she changed my outlook on life. For about a year and a half before meeting her, I had been writing down ideas and sketches. I had no idea what I was doing or if any of it was good but I loved it. Mrs. Reilly is too an entrepreneur but ran into troubles which forced her to find a new way to support her family. She became my entrepreneurial mentor and made me believe in myself and my future.

A few years later I would meet someone I already knew quite well who would change my life. It was at a family party where I was talking to my cousin Avi who happened to be a programmer and entrepreneur. I told him about my pitiful attempts to learn to program on my own and he offered to teach me. It was around this time that I was become intrigued by technology and the modern gold rush it was becoming. Without his help I would never have been able to come so close to making many of my sketches of technology ideas into reality.

A year and a half later, I learned Ruby, Sinatra, and I am well into learning Ruby on Rails.This blog will have updates on my process of learning to program and possibly my entrepreneurial endeavors.
