This year was my senior year of high school and I did a senior seminar on statistical programming.
I followed the curriculum of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins</a> on Coursera. I spent most days going through course material in the form of lectures and short assignments. 
<br>
I covered the following subjects:
<ul>
	<li>The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox</li>
	<li>R Programming</li>
	<li>Getting and Cleaning Data</li>
	<li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
	<li>Reproducible Research</li>
	<li>Regression Models</li>
</ul>

<br>
Final Project:
I used a database of real estate purchases in Mass to first try to assess the value of a home. I used different regression models that factored in numerous data points on each property including lot size, number of bedrooms, and town. Then I realized that one of the data points was the actual appraised value of the house by a realtor. Bad news: I wasted a lot of time trying to predict something that already existed. Good news: I was actually pretty close!
I then used this data to make a very interesting graph. I plotted the expected value of a house versus the actual amount sold for and found that the more you list over the appraised price, the less you will receive on average.
Take a look in the slides below!
