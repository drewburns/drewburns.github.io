Blog posts are like buses ... Darn! I already used that joke! <br><br>
I intended on taking a quick two week break to study for finals, but I got tied up with some other things which leaves me here. Luckily, I have a few projects I never did blog posts on, so that will give me something to write about. <br> <br>
I intend on continuing with Rails and Swift but would also like to start learning the R language. Statistical programming and machine learning looks like something that would be fun to learn and hopefully someday I can make something cool like AlphaGo.

Anyways, in the words of the Beatles: "Here comes the blog posts". Close enough.
