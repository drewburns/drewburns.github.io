After looking at the Stanford lecture about animation, I decided to wait on doing their Breakout Game and instead made this. The idea was to make a cool way to visualize a song using animation.

<h3>The app</h3>
For now the app only is able to play one song but I hope to come back and change that. The only way I was able to get the song breakdown data was in Javascript(wrote some of the code but used a library). This meant I had to copy the output from the Javascript into the app. The idea was to have all the songs on the phone work, but it was getting to the point where the time it took wasn't worth it.

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Swift</h4>
<li>Playing Songs</li>
<li>Animation</li>
<li>Push Animation</li>
<li>Timers</li>
<li>Adding subviews with code</li>

<li>Loading Songs</li>
</ul>
