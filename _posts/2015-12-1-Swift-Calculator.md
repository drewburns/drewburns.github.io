The code : [github] <br>

This is my first project in Swift, the newest language I am learning.
Swift is a whole new animal but the more I learn, the more it is similar to languages like Ruby and Javascript. This is a homework assignment from the Stanford Swift iTunes U class. Navigating Xcode is a challenge and getting used to the syntax of the code is quite difficult but the more I use it, the more I seem to like it. In this project, I learned all the basics of Swift and Xcode.
<ul>
	<p>XCode:</p>
	<li>Navigation Controller</li>
	<li>Split View Controller</li>
	<li>Auto layout</li>
	<br>
	<p>Swift:</p>
	<li>Closures</li>
	<li>Classes</li>
	<li>MVC's in Swift</li>
	<li>Functions</li>
	<li>Casting</li>
	<li>Recursion</li>
	<li>init</li>
	<li>UIBeizerPath / Bounds / Gestures</li>
</ul>

It is pretty cool to see the app pop up on your phone and actually work like something you can download on the App Store. The next project will be a recipe app that uses an API I made in Rails.
