This summer I had the pleasure of having an internship at <a href='https://learntoprogram.tv/'>Learn To Program </a> 

I didn't know what to expect coming in to the internship and was a bit scared I would have nothing to offer them. Maybe I didn't who knows ...

My first task was to write <a href="http://learntoprogram.wpengine.com/ruby-language-beginners/">a blog post</a> on an introduction to Ruby, the language which I know strongest. It took a couple of drafts but finally I presented something good enough to post on their blog. A few people have liked it on Facebook so I guess it can't be too bad. During the process I got to know Ben, a college student working there for the summer. We made a good combo because he could write well and I knew programming.

The next assignment was to write solutions to the labs on a <a href='https://learntoprogram.tv/courses/html5-specialist-designation'>HTML5 Course </a> on their site. This wasn't too difficult but I had to make sure it was all correct. I would feel pretty bad if my answer was wrong and a student learned the wrong way from my answer.

After small tasks in between, I was given a large project. I was tasked with <a href="https://github.com/drewburns/SummerInternship/tree/master/Learn%20To%20Program%20App"> creating an app that would allow access to one of their courses </a>. The idea was to create an app that would load an JSON file of a course and fill in the text/videos/images using the same layout for each course. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Phone Gap to make the app. After about three weeks of work, I finished the app. 

Overall, I learned valuable lessons and skills of working as a team. It was an absolute pleasure to work for this company.
