Well this isn't the post I wanted to ever make about MunchBunch but here we are.
MunchBunch was a food ordering app that allowed users to order food with people around them to save money.

Built the app in Swift and backend in Rails.
Acquired 200 users and 5 restaurants. Had zero idea what I was doing as a dumb sophomore so I failed.


Here's a demo of the app:

More to come eventually ...
