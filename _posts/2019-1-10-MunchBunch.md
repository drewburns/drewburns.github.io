Well this isn't the post I wanted to ever make about MunchBunch but here we are.
MunchBunch was a food ordering app that allowed users to order food with people around them to save money.

More to come soon ...
<!-- What I learned:
<ul>
	<li>Rails: I have made other sites in Rails but this was by far the biggest project I have done. The largest challenge in the building was creating a way for users to easily write and post articles. After hours of searching, we decided on using an open source WYSIWYG editor that we had to play around with a lot and integrate Clouindary image uploading. It ended up being super easy to use.</li>
	<li>Teamwork: This is the first project I had to work on with other people which was hard to get used to. I had to actually document code and use a lot of git features I haven't used before like merging (a lot of merging and branches). Furthermore we all had to be on the same page about what was happening in each page and why we were making certain choices.</li>
	<li>Design: This was very important because the goal was to get real sports fans and bloggers onto the site and posting. If the layout wasn't intuitive there are many other places to post their articles.</li>
	<li>Marketing/Startup: I sent out hundreds of emails,DMs, etc. to sports bloggers across many websites to try to get people to post on the site. Hopefully they post!</li>
</ul>
