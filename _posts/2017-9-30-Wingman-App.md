Over the past few years I have been teaching myself iOS development and the Swift language. I haven't made a real large project for an app yet but I decided to make one when I thought of Wingman.
Wingman is an app where you can anonymously put two friends into a chat and see the first few messages they say to each other. You're probably thinking, Andrew what's the point of that? And there really isn't a point. Its just something kind of dumb to screw around with. The only main purpose I thought of would be for middle schoolers to start drama by putting friends into chats with other girls or guys they like.

I built out the iOS app and did a beta on test flight. I also purchased a logo on Fiverr to round out the app.

What I learned:
<ul>
	<li>Firebase: This is the first time I have used Firebase and it was a great experience. I utilized the phone auth to login users and then used the realtime database to store user data. Also I used Firebase functions to automate some tasks and get them off the client side.</li>
	<li>Push Notification: I went through the process of push notifications, certificates, and that whole mess to finally just get those beautiful pushes. I hosted a quick web server that handled sending out the push notification with the certificate.</li>
	<li>Design: I had to make this app look nice because I wanted people to actually use it. I used a pretty minimal design but had to actually make nice looking buttons and flow that made sense for users.</li>
</ul>

P.S.
Shoutout to Max Janik and Tim Noto for helping me work on the idea and planning out how to position the app.

Take a look!
