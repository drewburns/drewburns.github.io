Here is the <a href="https://github.com/drewburns/ToDoApp">GitHub</a> page

The ToDo App was made a couple of months ago. It allows users to bookmark location and make tasks they need to complete at those locations.

<h3>What I learned:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>How to use maps</li>
 	<li>Core Data</li>
 	<li>Date and Time in Swift</li>
 	<li>Linking to other apps (Directions to stored locations with Apple Maps)</li>
</ul>
Instead of me writing about how the app works, here is a video:
